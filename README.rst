==========
Silverberg
==========

Silverberg is a connection pooled, low-level client API for Cassandra CQL3 in Twisted python.

Named after the SSS Silverberg, which contained the computer Cassandra in an episode of Red Dwarf.  Hey, all of the mythological references to Cassandra are all getting kinda old, no?

CQL3 is the new query language for Apache Cassandra.  You can use it almost, but not quite, like SQL from a traditional relational database
